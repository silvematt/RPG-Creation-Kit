The RPG Creation Kit is a toolset that makes the development of RPG games a lot easier and a lot more accessible. RPG games are known for their complexity especially on the programming side – with the RPG Creation Kit you will only have to focus in the creative part and in the game content, as the hard part is already there, ready for you to be used.

The project is designed to give you all the elements that you may need in order to make either a simple or a very complex and branched RPG game, with thousands of NPCs, multiple questlines, factions, locations, outcomes, and world-changing events.

The RPG Creation Kit is inspired by games as “The Elder Scrolls” and “Fallout”, and it aims to support those kind of games levels of complexity and depth.

The Kit has an approach towards making an RPG “Windows-oriented”, in the sense that there are many Editor Windows and Inspectors that will do almost all the job for you.
