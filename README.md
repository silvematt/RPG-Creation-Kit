The **RPG Creation Kit** is a toolset designed to make deep, complex RPG game development easier and more accessible. RPGs are known for their complexity, especially on the programming side, but you can now focus entirely on creativity and game content, the hard work is already done and ready for you to use.

The project is designed to give you all the elements you need to create either a simple or highly complex, branching RPG game, with thousands of NPCs, open-world, multiple questlines, factions, locations, outcomes, and world-changing events.

The Kit is designed with a user-friendly approach, featuring multiple Editor Windows and Inspectors that handle the technical heavy-lifting for you.
